<NOTES>
	
	This is a very simple file that tells the program what kind of blocks are in the game.
		If you wish to add a new block to the game, then simply give it a good name and
		add it to the bottom of the list.

	- IMPORTANT -

	When you give the block a name, that name will be used in the program. So in the box
		where you select the block you want to use, the name you gave your block will
		be portrayed there.
